 
Resources
=========

- implement set of SetTitle, SetVersion, AddJar, SetINI functions
    (instead of pecoff4j)
- implement loading of INI, splash, jars from exe resources
- check launch4j and others for their format for storing jars in exe and
  try to be compatible
- add option to ini file whether overriding is allowed for embedded ini.
- allow embedding of html to display if launcher cannot find appropriate
  java version
- add an api for accessing arbitrary resources on an exe/module
- associate a file type with secondary (or other) icon embedded.

? Maybe integrate RCEDIT into winrun4j binary and remove existing run on itself
  features. Should be minimal size overhead and would add useful features.  

Splash Screen
=============

- allow user to write text to splash screen window
- allow user to specify font and location of text
- allow user to change splash image on the fly
- allow user to store splash image in jar and specify via manifest
    (need a flag in INI: splash.searchManifest=true)

Build/Release
=============

- build 64 bit console version
- console version option to add "Press any key to continue..." at the end
- possibly split out win32 features from core executable
	* registry access
	* event log
	* resource access
	* shell api
	* possibly arbitrary function calls with callback support
	* implement a wrapper api over win32 functions (eg. dde, com?, 
	  shell)

OSGI Support
============

- create an osgi launcher. start with eclipse. embedded launcher for directory
  of jars with versions etc...
  equinox.application=org.boris.xlloop.dataservice.XLLoopDataService
  should create one for applications and one for services.    
- eclipse integration (run/debug winrun4j application)
- write an article about osgi service as windows service.
- create a bundle startup service + native filesystem listener for extra
  bundles that automatically get installed/started
  * probably need specific implementations for each osgi implementation...
