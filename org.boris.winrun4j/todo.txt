===========

- allow multiple worksheets
- allow writing of functions using a scripting language 
    (probably pluggable but start with rhino)
- console view for debugging
 
winrun4j
========

- implement set of SetTitle, SetVersion, AddJar, SetINI functions
    (instead of pecoff4j)
- implement loading of INI, splash, jars from exe resources
- allow user to write text to splash screen window
- allow user to change splash image on the fly

  try to be compatible

- also allow a server to indicate another server to use each time
  a new connection is created (ie. when no connection exists)
- client/server talk in xlopers
- separate out scripting example/provider to separate jar to remove excess 
  dependencies
- tray icon for stopping xllop/resetting connection?
- popup for long running functions?
